# Backend Documentation

## Executive Summary

This component implements a small FastAPI application that currently exposes a health/root endpoint. It's intended to host chatbot logic or proxy requests to language models or knowledge bases.

## Architecture Overview

- The backend is a Python FastAPI app. It is designed to run as an ASGI app (served by Uvicorn or another ASGI server).
- The codebase is minimal and currently exposes a single GET `/` endpoint for health checks. Chatbot-related endpoints (e.g., `/api/chat`) can be added alongside authentication, caching, and rate-limiting as needed.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI (0.117.1)
- Uvicorn (0.37.0) as the recommended ASGI server
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt` (httpx, python-dotenv, pydantic, websockets, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Open a terminal and change to the `backend` directory.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Windows PowerShell):
   - python -m venv .venv
   - .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
3. Install dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the app locally:
   - uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
5. Verify the health endpoint in your browser or with curl: `http://localhost:8000/` should return `{"Hello": "World"}`

## API Documentation

- GET / - Health check
  - Response: 200 OK
  - Body: {"Hello": "World"}

Future endpoints (suggested)

- POST /api/chat - Accepts user messages and returns chatbot responses
- GET /api/model-status - Returns status of connected LLM or services

## Configuration

- Environment variables (use a `.env` file and `python-dotenv`):
  - PORT - port to run the app (default 8000)
  - LOG_LEVEL - logging level
  - MODEL_API_KEY - API key for external LLM services (if applicable)

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for pinned versions. Key packages include:

- fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, pydantic, python-dotenv, websockets

## Troubleshooting

- If you see import errors, ensure your virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed.
- For port conflicts, change the `--port` argument when launching Uvicorn or set the `PORT` environment variable.
